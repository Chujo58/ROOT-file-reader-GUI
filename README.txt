This code was written to easily read the root files obtained from the CoMPASS software.
Do note that this code is not completly done and that modifications will be added to it in the future.

You will need to install a few libraries in order for the code to work. Some of them are less useful than other:
- Spinmob
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Uproot
- Tkinter
- Pyqtgraph and its requirements
- darkdetect

All the libraries mentioned above can be downloaded easily via a pip install.
